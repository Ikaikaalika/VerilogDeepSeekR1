CLI Reference
Comprehensive reference for the Thunder Compute CLI. Manage instances (create, start, stop, delete), configure GPUs/CPUs, handle files, and use snapshots.
​
Account Management

​
Login

Authenticate the CLI, which provides a link to the console where you can generate an API token.


Copy

Ask AI
tnr login
Under the hood, this generates and saves an API token to ~/.thunder/token. You can store a token file here to programmatically authenticate, or by setting the TNR_API_TOKEN environment variable in your shell.

​
Logout

Log out of the CLI with:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr logout
This deletes the stored API token.

​
API Token Management

Generate/manage tokens in the console
Tokens never expire but can be revoked
Use unique tokens per device
​
Managing Instances

​
Create an Instance

Create a new Thunder Compute instance:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr create
This creates a new instance with default configuration and automatically assigns an instance ID.

​
CPU Configuration

Configure custom vCPU count:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr create --vcpus <vcpu_count>
Each vCPU comes with 8GB of RAM. For example, a 4 core instance has 32GB of RAM, and an 8 core instance has 64GB of RAM.

By default, 4 vCPUs and 32GB of memory are included with your instance. Additional vCPUs are billed hourly at the rates shown here
​
GPU Configuration

Specify a GPU type:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr create --gpu <gpu_type>
Available GPU types:

t4: NVIDIA T4 (16GB VRAM) - Best for most ML workloads
a100 (default): NVIDIA A100 (40GB VRAM) - For large models and high-performance computing
a100xl : NVIDIA A100 (80GB VRAM) - For even larger models, the biggest and the best
You can use the --num-gpus flag to specify multiple GPU configurations:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr create --gpu <gpu_type> --num-gpus <n>
​
Template Configuration

Templates make it easy to quickly launch common AI tools. Your instance will already be configured with everything you need to get running to generate images, run an LLM, and more.

To use a template, add the --template flag when creating an instance:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr create --template <template_name>
Available templates:

ollama: Ollama server environment
comfy-ui: ComfyUI for AI image generation
webui-forge: WebUI Forge for Stable Diffusion
After instance creation, start the server using start-<template_name> when connected. For example:


Copy

Ask AI
start-ollama
​
Mode Configuration

Choose between prototyping and production modes:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr create --mode <mode>
Available modes:

prototyping (default): Development mode optimized for intermittent workloads
production: Premium instance with maximum compatibility, stability, and reliability for production workloads
​
Stop an Instance

Stops a running instance.


Copy

Ask AI
tnr stop <instance_ID>
Stopped instances continue to accrue storage cost.
​
Start an Instance

Starts a stopped instance.


Copy

Ask AI
tnr start <instance_ID>
​
Delete an Instance


Copy

Ask AI
tnr delete <instance_ID>
This action permanently removes an instance and all associated data.
​
Using instances

​
Connect to an Instance

Use the connect command to access your instance. This wraps SSH, managing keys while automatically setting up everything you need to get started.


Copy

Ask AI
tnr connect <instance_ID>
The instance must be running before you can connect to it. See if the instance is running and get the instance ID (default 0) with tnr status.

​
Port Forwarding

Connect with port forwarding with the -t or --tunnel flag:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr connect <instance_ID> -t PORT1 -t PORT2
Features:

Forward multiple ports using repeated -t/--tunnel flags
Example: tnr connect 0 -t 8000 -t 8080 forwards both ports 8000 and 8080
Enables local access to remote web servers, APIs, and services
​
Copy Files

Transfer files between local and remote instance with the scp command:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr scp <source_path> <destination_path>
You can transfer files in either direction, from your local machine to an instance, or from the instance to your local machine. You indicate the direction of transfer with the path format, shown below.

Path format:

Remote: instance_id:path (e.g., 0:/home/user/data)
Local: Standard paths (e.g., ./data or /home/user/file.txt)
Must specify exactly one remote and one local path
Paths can be either absolute or relative.
Examples:


Copy

Ask AI
# Upload to instance
tnr scp ./local_file.txt 0:/remote/path/

# Download from instance
tnr scp 0:/remote/file.txt ./local_path/
File transfers have a 60-second connection timeout. SSH key setup, compression, and ~/ expansion are handled automatically.
​
Managing Snapshots

Snapshots capture the state of a stopped instance’s disk, allowing you to create new instances from that point in time.

​
Create a Snapshot

Create a snapshot from a stopped instance:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr snapshot <instance_ID> <snapshot_name>
<instance_ID>: The ID of the instance to snapshot. The instance must be stopped.
<snapshot_name>: A unique name for your snapshot.
Must contain only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-).
Must be between 1 and 62 characters long.
Snapshots are stored compressed to save space. You can view the compressed size using the --list command after creation.

You can use a snapshot as a template to launch new instances. The snapshot defines the initial disk content and size. While you can modify other configuration options (like vCPU count or GPU type) during the tnr create command, the new instance’s disk size must be equal to or greater than the original instance’s disk size. Decreasing the disk size is not supported.

Copy

Ask AI
tnr create --template <snapshot_name> [--gpu <new_gpu_type>] #etc
​
List Snapshots

List all available snapshots and their details, including compressed size:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr snapshot --list
​
Delete a Snapshot

Delete a specific snapshot by name:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr snapshot --delete <snapshot_name>
This action permanently deletes the snapshot. It does not affect instances created from this snapshot.
​
System Management

​
Modify Instance

Modify the instance’s vCPU count (and RAM), GPU type, or disk size:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr modify <instance_ID> \
  --disk-size-gb <new_size_GB> \
  --gpu <new_gpu_type> \
  --vcpus <new_vcpu_count> \
  --mode <mode>
All flags are optional, but at least one change must be provided.

These changes will affect the billing price of the instance.

Instances must be stopped to modify the vCPU count/RAM, GPU type, or mode. You can resize disk at any time.

Each additional vCPU adds 8GB of RAM to your instance.

Available modes:

prototyping (default): Optimized for cost-effective development
production: Premium instances with maximum compatibility, stability, and reliability
Storage can only be increased, not decreased. For smaller storage needs, create a new instance and transfer your files.
​
View Instance Status

List all instances and details including instance_ID, IP Address, Disk Size, GPU Type, GPU Count, vCPU Count, RAM, and Template:


Copy

Ask AI
tnr status
use the --no-wait flag to disable automatic monitoring for status updates
